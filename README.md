# Post-Office-Sim-Code
This program simulates a post office line with a worker servicing the customer at the front of the line.
The program simulates the random chance of a new customer arriving and being added to the queue, the random
chance of the customer at the end of the line becoming disgruntled and leaving, and also the random chance
of the customer at the front of the line being asked to step aside to fill out information. When a customer
is asked to step aside, the next customer in line can step up and begin being serviced. The user is prompted to
enter the total simulation time (the number of iterations the for loop runs), the total service time (how long
it takes a customer to be serviced), and also the probabilities that each of the three random events listed above
will occur. After executing the code, the program prints out the customers that were serviced, the customers that
were disgruntled and left, and also the customers still waiting to be serviced after the simulation ends.
